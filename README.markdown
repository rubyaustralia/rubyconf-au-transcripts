## RubyConf AU Transcripts

These markdown files are sourced from the live captioning at the event - they may not be perfect, but they _are_ an excellent starting point, for anyone who prefers text over (or along with) the video.

Edits are certainly welcome - the originals are copied from Word documents, so they're not put together with web publishing in mind (or any publishing really, beyond the display during the conference). Please note that the goal is to have these files match the video content (rather than being a tidied up version of the presenter's message - the author may have written a blog post for that purpose).
